        Why Linus shows his Middlefinger? Nvidia is a video card maker.They make a driver for their video cards to work on Linux, but it's not open source so it can't be integrated in Linux. Linux developers decided to make an open source driver for Nvidia, basically working for them for free.<br>
        The developers doing Nvidia's job for free asked Nvidia to tell them what the technical specs of the cards were, to which Nvidia replied "fuck you".
        To which Linus Torvalds replied a well deserved "fuck you". What a hero, truly!
